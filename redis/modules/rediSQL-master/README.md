# RediSQL

RediSQL is a module for Redis that embed a completely functional SQLite database.

RediSQL enables new paradigm where is possible to have several smaller decentralized databases instead of a single giant one.

_With great powers comes great responsability_ (cit. Uncle Ben)

# Documentation

This readme will provide you with the basics, however for deeper documentation you should look here: [redbeardlab.tech/rediSQL/](http://redbeardlab.tech/rediSQL/)

## Motivation

I love the agility provided by Redis, however, several times, I wished I had a little more structure in my in-memory database.

Even basic SQL is very powerful and years upon years of experience on several SQL implementations have brought us a very mature product that we can now exploit with confidence.

Between all the SQL implementation, the one that best fitted the need for this module is definitely SQLite, for its velocity, portability, simplicity, and capability to work in memory.

## Getting start

There are three main way to get RediSQL.

The first way is to use docker, just pull the image and you are ready to go:

`docker run siscia/redisql:latest` 

the official docker hub repo is: [https://hub.docker.com/r/siscia/redisql/](https://hub.docker.com/r/siscia/redisql/)

The second way is to download the public release directly from github following the [release link](https://github.com/RedBeardLab/rediSQL/releases)

With the `.so` you can start redis passing the object as argument like so:

```
./redis-server --loadmodule librediSQL.so 
```

Please note that you need to run redis > 4.0 to use modules and RediSQL is not an exception.

The last way is to compile the module yourself:

## Compiling and contributing

If you want to compile the module yourself or contribute to the project you can simply clone the repo

```
$ git clone http://github.com/RedBeardLab/rediSQL/
Cloning into 'rediSQL'...
remote: Counting objects: 1404, done.
remote: Total 1404 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1404
Receiving objects: 100% (1404/1404), 7.28 MiB | 487.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (513/513), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Then move inside the directory and compile the module:

```
$ cargo build --release 
```

At this point, you should have the `.so` inside the `target/release/` directory.

Now launch Redis with the module load will looks similarly to this:

```
$ ~/redis-4.0-rc1/src/redis-server --loadmodule ./target/release/librediSQL.so

## Walkthrough

After starting redis with the module rediSQL it will be just the redis you learn to love:

```
$ ~/redis-4.0-rc1/src/redis-cli 
127.0.0.1:6379> 
127.0.0.1:6379> SET A 3
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET A
"3"
```

But you will also able to use all the API described below:

```
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.CREATE_DB DB
OK
# Start creating a table on the default DB
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "CREATE TABLE foo(A INT, B TEXT);"
DONE
# Insert some data into the table
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO foo VALUES(3, 'bar');"
OK
# Retrieve the data you just inserted
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM foo;"
1) 1) (integer) 3
   2) "bar"
# Of course you can make multiple tables
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "CREATE TABLE baz(C INT, B TEXT);"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO baz VALUES(3, 'aaa');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO baz VALUES(3, 'bbb');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO baz VALUES(3, 'ccc');"
OK
# And of course you can use joins
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM foo, baz WHERE foo.A = baz.C;"

1) 1) (integer) 3
   2) "bar"
   3) (integer) 3
   4) "aaa"
2) 1) (integer) 3
   2) "bar"
   3) (integer) 3
   4) "bbb"
3) 1) (integer) 3
   2) "bar"
   3) (integer) 3
   4) "ccc"
127.0.0.1:6379> 
```

Also the `LIKE` operator is included:

```
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "CREATE TABLE text_search(t TEXT);"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO text_search VALUES('hello');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO text_search VALUES('banana');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO text_search VALUES('apple');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> 
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM text_search WHERE t LIKE 'h_llo';"
1) 1) "hello"
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM text_search WHERE t LIKE '%anana';"
1) 1) "banana"
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "INSERT INTO text_search VALUES('anana');"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM text_search;"
1) 1) "hello"
2) 1) "banana"
3) 1) "apple"
4) 1) "anana"
127.0.0.1:6379> REDISQL.EXEC DB "SELECT * FROM text_search WHERE t LIKE 'a%';"
1) 1) "apple"
2) 1) "anana"
``` 

Now you can create tables, insert data on those tables, make queries, remove elements, everything.

## Contributing

I am going to accept pull request here on github.

## OpenSource and the necessity of real support and charge for my time.

[How to Charge for your Open Source](http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/11/23/how-to-charge-for-your-open-source/) by Mike Perham brings good arguments on the necessity to charge for work done by developers, even in the Open Source world.

I myself have started a lot of Open Source project that, eventually, are all dead because I wasn't able to dedicate the right amount of time to them.

I am hoping to find the necessary funds to keep maintain this project.

I am starting with only an Open Source version and then move to an enterprise version adding the necessary features.
